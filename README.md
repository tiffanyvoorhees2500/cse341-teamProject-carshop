# **Team Car Shop API Documentation**

Welcome to the **Team Car Shop Api**, your gateway to managing car, brand, user, and review data. Authentication is required for certain operations. A homepage and Swagger UI is available for easy exploration.

## **Base URL**

[**Team Car Shop on Render**](https://cse341-teamproject-carshop.onrender.com)

## **Our Homepage**

Unlike most Api you might use while building projects, we wanted ours to have a built in landing page. (Mostly because we donâ€™t have a website like other Api's ;) This page gives you some quick information, like if you are logged in or not, and also gives you quick links.
- `/login`: Login
- `/logout`: Logout
- `/api-docs`: Visit Swagger UI
- `documentation`: Link to documentation

Besides these few quick links the Api can be used as normal, either by adding `/yourWantend/path/orMaybeCar:ID` in the url or with Swagger Ui.
